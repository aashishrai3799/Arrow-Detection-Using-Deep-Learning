## Digit Recognition model with only 7.9K trainable parameters. 
## Dataset used: MNIST-digit-dataset
Tensorflow 2.1.0, Keras API

Train Accuracy: 99%

Validation (10% training data) Accuracy: >99.4%

Test Accuracy: >99.4%

The model is light-weight and can be trained easily on any machine.
However, to avoid training, download pre-trained model (mnist.h5).
