A simple CNN based approach to detect arrows in an image. The work can also be extended to detect arrows in a live Webcam feed and/or existing video using OpenCV module. (refer 'Arrow_detect_run.ipynb')

Both keras and tensorflow implementations are available.

### Dataset
A self-made dataset is used. The dataset has 3 classes Left, Right and None. Left and Right contains the corresponding arrow images and None contains all other images.

### Result
#### Accuracy: 99.8%

### To run the code directly, just download the model (arrow.h5) and 'Arrow_detect_run.ipynb'.
