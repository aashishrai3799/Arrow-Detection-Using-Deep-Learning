# Arrow-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning

A simple CNN based approach to detect arrows in an image. The work can also be extended to detect arrows in a live Webcam feed and/or existing video using OpenCV module.

### Dataset
A self-made dataset is used. The dataset has 3 classes Left, Right and None. Left and Right contains the corresponding arrow images and None contains all other images.
